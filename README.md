# Domination
This project was my final project for AP Computer Science
at Homestead High School.

##Summary

![Red Bolt](https://github.com/YangVincent/Domination/blob/master/Animations/RedFightingJuggernautMonster/red3.png)

This was designed to be a hybrid of 
[Canyon Defense](http://www.miniclip.com/games/canyon-defense/en/#t-c-f-C) and
[Double Edged](http://www.nitrome.com/games/doubleedged/#.VXtXShNViko).
This is a two player game, where each person sends different units towards
the opponent on a grid. 

##Gameflow
People get in-game money periodically, which they can then use to buy more units
or powerups, such as extra health, etc.

##Features
* Sprites
* Money
* Store
* MultiThreading
* Cheats
* Powerups
* Panel switching through CardLayout
